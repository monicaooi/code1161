TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
The coding work has gotten exponentially harder and more difficult to understand but alright. I'm still having troubles on week 2 exercise 3 as I still don't understand the concept. Week 3 exercise is mind blowingly confusing- reminds me of that meme, the one different stage of brain explosion. On a better note, there is code academy, interactive and teaches step by step. I started that and although there are some parts I don't understand, it has been alright, the very first basic things are embedded in my brain now and it is only a matter of understanding the rest. I have decided to kepp going with this, because, really I have no choice. I don't want to fail, but I know that I won't get the best marks so Fighting! I may be late on the exercised but I'm hoping that once I sort of understand the the concepts, I will go back to them and finish it off. :\ hopefully this will be ok, becuase honestly this is really the only way for me to go about it. I have tasks I need to do and firstly, I do not understand what it wants, and what it means and secondly staring at it won't really do any good for productivity. 

j = 9 #variable used for printing spaces
for i in range (1,10,2) : #for loop used for printing stars
        print (' ' * j + 1 * '*')
        j = j - 1
learnt this off the internet to make the pyramid. I probably still dont understand it.

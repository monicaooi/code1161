TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I have learnt that computer design is totally different from what I have imagined. I thought it was using the adobe suite and perhaps other software like that but its coding. I was in a Design degree program at COFA last year and moved to computational design because I thought it was best to build up my design skills on the computer since I am more of a computer person rather than hands and also I wanted a challenge. 
I admit, the first lecture and tutorial really had me scared and I wanted to turn back because its different and I don't know anything about coding to be honest and at the most I knew was html, its boring and annoying and maybe something to do with ios and android???
Adobe was my strong point and though most probably won't be using it in this course I will try to be positive in learning something new. I will try my best in learning this new language and I hope that I will come to a point where I will actually enjoy doing this course. 
I was actually suprised that there was not alot of people doing this course. 
I also learnt- that lightbulb moment switch one in my head when one of the tutors in the class explained what computational design was and the "role" is had within the built environment. I found that really helpful. 
Also coming from COFA where macs were mostly used, I found out that this course is a windows prefered and naturally I was a bit scared and shock because I've worked with a mac for a long time and that maybe during this couse my computer would suddenly break down because it just couldn't handel the work or something like that. 
I'd also like to point out that I'm more cofortable using moodle because everything I needed was in one place and it felt more organized. 

WHAT I DON'T KNOW
* coding- language and syntax, Python
* How to find the assessments and exams timetable for this course
* using terminal on mac 

WHAT I'M GOING TO DO 
* I've already search for tutorial video on Lynda.com and youtube, added them to a playlist and if I can, download them so I can watch on the go
* next lesson I'm going to ask the teacher or someone to direct me to the page
* I will research resource later this week for terminal.
